        <h1>Zachariah Grande's Biography</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Zachariah Grande, and I am a first-year data science major at Syracuse University. I would like to be a part of the <strong>analytical revolution</strong>, focusing on the application of analytical models to maximize efficiency in business computations, such as supply chain management, database organization, server operations, and etcetera.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some skills I have already acquired in this field are graphic design, data visualization, professional journalism experience, and managing an online shopping database for a grocery retailer.

        <h2>Personal Information</h2>
        <p>
            Outside of my major and career path, my interests are in participating and watching sports, specifically the Boston Celtics and Cleveland Browns. Iâ€™m a huge witty TV series fan, especially British dramas such as Sex Education, Black Mirror, Fleabag, and TEOTFW. I am also quite weak to any chocolate treats, so much so that gifts from my family almost always consist of some chocolate portion. Regarding such, I am part of a small, split family. However, I believe that this has only aided me in my strength and versatility in dealing with different circumstantial issues and the ability to relate upon multiple ongoing problems at once.
        </p>
        <p>
            At 18 years old, I feel that I have the experience, potential, and time to shape my skill-set for any obstacle and challenge presented in front of me regarding any position in the current workforce, especially in any computational field.
