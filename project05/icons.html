                    <p>Red may not have been the first coach in Celtics history but he is very much the most notable and iconic coach in franchise history. Known as one of the most legendary coaches of all time, Red coached 16 seasons for the Celtics and was a part of 9 NBA championships. Red served to represent a baseline of success for the franchise as it grew to what it is today.</p>

                    <p>One of two player-coaches (the other Dave Cowens), Bill Russell proved a mastermind defensive coordinator and anchor. Through his 3 seasons, he won 162 games and won 2 NBA Championships, a feat that would never be replicated by a player-coach and likely never will as the tradition has grown out of the game today.</p>

                    <p>After a successful NBA playing career with the team spanning 9 seasons, Heinsohn would go on to serve another 9 seasons as the Celtics head coach starting in 1969. Winning 427 out of his 690 games, Tommy’s teams reigned in two NBA championships during his tenure. After his coaching career, Heinsohn would become a color commentator for the Celtics all the way until 2020, marking 63 years as a part of the franchise.</p>

                    <p>Fitch coached in the NBA for 25 years, 4 of them being with the Celtics in the early 80s. This proved a great honor, as he would win 242 out of 328 games, the second best winning percentage in franchise history, an NBA title, and would later be named one of the 10 Greatest Coaches of All Time by the NBA.</p>

                    <p>Another all-time Celtic great that turned to coaching, Jones coached for 11 seasons in Boston, 5 of those being as a head coach. Boasting the best win% in franchise history along with two titles, Jones is one of the most decorated Celtics across his playing and coaching careers.</p>

                    <h4>Doc Rivers [2005-2013]</h4>
                    <p>Doc Rivers took over in 2005 after a couple of unfulfilling playoff runs to start the 2000s. He would go on to coach for essentially a decade for the Celtics, notably being the coach behind the Celtics Big 3 and 2008 championship run. With the 2nd most games as a coach, Rivers made the playoffs in 6 of his 8 seasons, a great accomplishment in the modern age of basketball.</p>

                    <h4>Brad Stevens [2013-2021]</h4>
                    <p>When Doc Rivers refused to coach a “rebuilding” team, Brad Stevens from Butler stepped up and turned a 25-win team into a perennial playoff appearance. Stevens is known for being one of the smartest head coaches of the modern era of basketball, specifically on the defensive end, and leading teams with subpar talent to unparalleled success. Despite never catching an NBA title, Stevens was crucial to turning around the Celtics organization in the mid-2010s and developing the current stars of the team before being promoted to President of Basketball Operations in 2021.</p>

                    <p>The current coach of the Celtics, Mazzulla had the luxury of inheriting a great team and improving them to elite. Winning 97 of his 134 games at the time of this writing, Mazzulla is continuing to prove that his success as a coach is deserved and is looking to maintain his culture of winning as the Celtics fight for an elusive championship.</p>

He was the blueprint for ball-handling of his era, and his play led him to a franchise-leading 10 All-NBA first teams and 6 championships alongside Bill Russell.

Heinsohn was a physical player, smart coach, and colorful announcer in his long and infamous career with the Celtics. A part of 8 Championships, Heinsohn played a critical role in making the Celtics franchise a dynasty and had his #15 retired by the organization in 1966.</p>

Given the nicknames “Winner”, “Gentleman”, and “Mr. Clutch”, Same Jones cemented his place in NBA and Celtics history with valuable contributions to a plethora of championship runs and had his #24 retired in 1969.</p>

He would have his #17 retired soon after his basketball retirement.</p>

                    <p>Often debated with Russell as the best Celtic of all time, Larry Bird has become a face of the franchise even after his retirement. One of the highest basketball IQs and shooting strokes of all time, Larry used his size and smarts to dominate the league and winning 3 straight MVPs in the 80s along with 3 championships (and 3 finals MVPS). The 6th overall pick in 1979 would have his #33 retired in 1993.</p>

McHale’s #32 would go on to be retired in 1994 and would continue to make his mark in the NBA by becoming a head coach for numerous teams before his final retirement.</p>

                    <p>A homegrown superstar, Pierce came into a rebuilding Celtics team that was finally starting to slow down after multiple dynasties. Pierce was a constant of a team trying to find a winning strategy for nearly a decade before finally figuring it out in 2008, when Pierce would win the Finals MVP award in an entertaining finals matchup against Kobe Bryant’s Lakers. Pierce, one of the best scorers in Celtics history, would be traded for the draft pick that would end up becoming Jayson Tatum, allowing him to help the team even after his departure. #36 would be retired in Pierce’s honor in 2018. </p>
