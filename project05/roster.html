                    <h3>Jrue Holiday</h3>
                    <p>The trade for Jrue Holiday was a bittersweet one for Celtics fans, as although they brought in a perennial all-defensive guard with multiple high-scoring seasons and all-star appearances, it was at the expense of Robert Williams, a young rising center developed with the team, and Malcolm Brogdon, the reigning 6th Man of the Year at the time. Regardless, Jrue has been a huge addition, providing veteran championship experience and shooting a career high 42.8% on 3-pointers this season.</p>

                    <h3>Derrick White</h3>
                    <p>Derrick White was another player brought in through trade, as the Celtics sent out Josh Richardson, Romeo Langford, and a 1st round pick for The Buffalo. A seamless fit, Derrick White is in his 3rd season with the Celtics and has had a number of signature moments in his tenure, most notably a buzzer-beating game-winner in Game 6 of the 2023 ECF.</p>

                    <h3>Jaylen Brown</h3>
                    <p>One of two homegrown superstars on the Celtics today, Jaylen’s selection as 3rd overall in the 2016 draft met heavy criticism. A raw prospect, it took Jaylen a couple years to get the ball rolling, but since then has been highly productive and a staple of the Celtics core. Making his 3rd all-star appearance this season, Jaylen has made a name for himself as one of the most athletic high-scoring wings in the league today.</p>

                    <h3>Jayson Tatum</h3>
                    <p>Standing at 6’9 and around 230 lbs, Tatum previews the ideal build of an NBA superstar in the modern age. Bursting onto the scene by leading the Celtics to Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Finals against LeBron James in the 2018 playoffs as a rookie, Tatum has become a household name and face of both the Celtics franchise and the NBA as a whole. With 5 All-Star appearances and likely 4 All-NBA nominations in just his first 7 seasons, Tatum is on track to cement himself as one of the best Celtics of all time.</p>

                    <h3>Kristaps Porzingis</h3>
                    <p>A 7’3 center who can consistently punish teams down low and stretch the floor from 3-point range simply sounds like a pipe dream, but that’s what Kristaps Porzingis provides. Kristaps was drafted by the Knicks and made an All-star appearance in 2018 before dealing with a string of injuries that led to less productive seasons on other teams. However, after a great couple seasons in Washington, Brad Stevens decided to take the injury risk and trade fan favorite and longest-tenured Celtic Marcus Smart to acquire the big man. The risk has paid off so far, with Porzingis posting career highs in efficiency as he helps lead the Celtics to the best record in the NBA.</p>

                    <h3>Al Horford</h3>
                    <p>Al Horford has had both a All-star and All-defensive appearances during his Celtics tenure, and has completely altered his game to fit with the modernity of the game as he ages. Now 37 years old, Horford has gone from being one of the best players on the team in his first stint, to being a leader and 6th starter off the bench currently. Horford posts one of the highest 3-point percentages among big men and continues to be an elite defensive piece for the Cs.</p>

                    <h3>Sam Hauser</h3>
                    <p>Hauser failed to find minutes in his rookie season but grew into a respectable piece of the rotation in his second year, before solidifying his “first-man-off-the-bench” status currently. Hauser may be a slightly streaky shooter, but his spacing and defensive versatility at 6’8 has made him a highly impactful bench piece.</p>

                    <h3>Payton Pritchard</h3>
                    <p>Payton has had ups and downs as an NBA player, which is expected of a 6’1 guard in today’s game, but his tenacity has never wavered. Using his unique shooting ability and snakey ball-handling, Pritchard has finally carved a role in the rotation and guaranteed his spot in the league.</p>

                    <h3>Xavier Tillman</h3>
                    <p>Essentially a mini-Al Horford, the Celtics traded end-of-bench piece Lamar Stevens and 2 second round picks for Tillman to provide extra big man depth and another defensive anchor to the team as they try to add to their championship push.</p>
